 <summary> Week 1 </summary>

# What is Data Governance

* Data governance is all about managing data well, but data governance is not restricted to only data management.
* Today, when data is managed well, it can drive innovation and growth and can be an enterprise’s most abundant and important lever for success.
* Successful data governance also means that data risks can be minimized, and data compliance and regulatory requirements can be met with ease.
* This can bring important comfort to business leaders who, in some jurisdictions, can now be personally liable for issues arising from poor data management.
* Every organization manages data at some level. All businesses generate, process, use, and store data as a result of their daily operations.
* But there’s a huge difference between businesses that casually manage data and those that consider data to be a valuable asset and treat it accordingly.
* This difference is characterized by the degree to which there are formalities in managing data.

# Data Governance vs Data Management

* Within the EIM space, there are many terms that sound like they might mean the same thing.
* There is often confusion about the difference between data governance and data management.
* Data governance is focused on roles and responsibilities, policies, definitions, metrics, and the lifecycle of data.
* Data management is the technical implementation of data governance.
* For example, databases, data warehouses and lakes, application programming interfaces (APIs), analytics software, encryption, data crunching, and architectural design and implementation are all data management features and functions.

# Data Governance versus Information Governance 

* Similarly, in EIM, you may want clarity on the difference between data governance and information governance.
* Data governance generally focuses on data, independent of its meaning.
* For example, you may want to govern the security of patient data and staff data from a policy and process perspective, despite their differences. The interest here is in the data, not as much in the business context.
* Information governance is entirely concerned with the meaning of the data and its relationship in terms of outcomes and value to the organization, customers, and other stakeholders.
* This shouldn’t present an issue as long as the strategy for data governance is well understood.
* You should understand the context of data, a concept known as data intelligence, and the desired business outcomes, to complement data governance efforts in a valuable manner.

# The value of Data Governance

* Fundamentally, data governance is driven by a desire to increase the value of data and reduce the risks associated with it. It forces a leap from an ad hoc approach to data to one that is strategic in nature.

# Advantages of good data governance

* Improved data quality
* Expanded data value
* Increased data compliance
* Improved data-driven decision-making
* Enhanced business performance
* Greater sharing and use of data across the enterprise and externally
* Increased data availability and accessibility
* Improved data search
* Reduced risks from data-related issues
* Reduced data management costs
* Established rules for handling data
* Any one of these alone is desirable, but a well-executed and maintained data governance program will deliver many of these and more.
* For example, poor-quality data that is not current, inaccurate, and incomplete can lead to operating inefficiencies and poor decision-making.
* Data governance does not emerge by chance. It’s a choice and requires organizational commitment and investment.

# Creating a Data Governance Program

* Defining the vision, goals, and benefits.
* Analyzing the current state of data governance and management.
* Developing a proposal based on the first two steps, including a draft plan.
* Achieving leadership approval.
* Designing and developing the program.
* Implementing the program.
* Monitoring and measuring performance.
* Maintaining the program.
* Data governance is about managing data well and helping to deliver its optimum value to your organization. It includes ensuring your data is available, usable, and secure.

# Developing a Data Governance Framework

* While there are many framework variations to choose from, including ISACA’s Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies (COBIT) IT governance framework, they share some common components that address people, processes, and technology.

# Leadership and Strategy

* Your data governance program must be aligned with the strategy of the organization.
*  For example, how can data governance support the role that data plays in enabling growth in specific markets?
* Data plays a role in many aspects of organizational strategy, including risk management, innovation, and operational efficiencies, so you must ensure there’s a clear alignment between these aspects and the goals of data governance.

# Roles and Responsibilities

* Your data governance program will only be possible with the right people doing the right things at the right time.
* Every data governance framework includes the identification and assignment of specific roles and responsibilities, which range from the information technology (IT) team to data stewards.

# Policies, Processes and Standards

* At the heart of every data governance program are the policies, processes, and standards that guide responsibilities and support uniformity across the organization.
* Each of these must be designed, developed, and deployed. Depending on the size and complexity of the organization, this can take significant effort.
* Policies, processes, and standards must include accountability and enforcement components; otherwise it’s possible they will be dead on arrival.

# Metrics

* The data governance program must have a mechanism to measure whether it is delivering the expected results.
* Capturing metrics and delivering them to a variety of stakeholders is important for maintaining support, which includes funding.
* You’ll want to know if your efforts are delivering on the promise of the program.
* Based on the metrics, you and your team can make continuous improvements (or make radical changes) to ensure that the program is producing value.

# Tools

* Based on the metrics, you and your team can make continuous improvements (or make radical changes) to ensure that the program is producing value.
* These include tools for master data management, data catalogs, search, security, integration, analytics, and compliance.
* In recent years, many data science-related tools have made leaps in terms of incorporating ease-of-use and automation.
* What used to be complex has been democratized and empowered more team members to better manage and derive value from data.

# Communication and Collaroration

* With the introduction of data governance and the ongoing, sometimes evolving, requirements, high-quality communications are key.
* This takes many forms, including in-person meetings, emails, newsletters, and workshops.
* Change management, in particular, requires careful attention to ensure that impacted team members understand how the changes brought about by the data governance program affect them and their obligations.
* A large number of disparate stakeholders need to work together in order to effectively govern data.
* It also requires clear channels between teams, such as regular meetings. Online collaboration platforms are increasingly being used too.

# Preparing for Data Governance

* Data governance requires careful treatment, beginning with understanding whether an organization is ready to accept it.
* As the following sections make clear, there are some traps that you can avoid if you and your team are diligent.
* Being ready as an organization involves determining the extent to which a data culture exists.
* Intuitively you can conclude that an immature, reactive data culture, where data is simply handled in an ad hoc manner, is an entirely different experience than a sophisticated data-driven culture.
* There are other prerequisites for data governance success. These include ensuring that the organization’s strategy is fully aligned with the proposed program.
* As mentioned, any misalignment here is the number one reason data governance program deployments fail.

# Data Culture

* Many well-designed projects and initiatives fall flat and fail even though their teams seem to have done everything right.
* Too often, the work gets deployed into an environment that is either not ready for change or doesn’t have the optimum conditions for success.
* Culture will always defeat the greatest of strategies almost every time. Imagine for a moment designing and deploying a data governance program for an organization that has little or no data culture.
* Intuitively this sounds like a disaster in the making. To be fair, every organization has some form of a data culture; it just might not be in an ideal state.

# Assessing the Data Culture 

* If you want to increase your chances of success - you need to understand the data culture of your organization and determine how to broaden and mature it if necessary.
* You need an environment for success.
* On a basic level, data culture is how your organization values data and how it manages and uses it.
* There’s a wide chasm between companies that simply manage data as a consequence of doing business versus those that consider data central to how their organization operates and makes decisions
* Effective data cultures support and empower all employees, from the newest intern to the CEO, to access and use meaningful and timely data for their work.
* Such cultures ensure that employees have attained the skills they need to use data analytics and can make good data-driven decisions.
* It’s not an overstatement to say that these types of organizations are often defined by their enlightened and competitive use of data.
* In a data culture, decisions don’t rely on gut feelings, guesses, or the opinion of the highest-paid/ranking person in the room. Rather, decisions are based on data and the insights they can produce.
* In a world undergoing rapid digital transformation, data is the metaphorical oil that is powering and enabling it all.
* To be competitive, a progressive data-driven strategy is no longer optional. It’s a central concern. Data culture can be now considered a new way of doing business in the digital age.
* Leaders in all types of organizations are recognizing that to succeed in the third decade of the 21st century and beyond, they must leverage the enormous power and value of data.
* This acknowledgment, and the actions that senior leaders take to foster the use of data, is the primary success factor in the development and maturity of an effective data culture.
* Trust comes in a close second. This means that team members will only make data-driven decisions if they trust the data they’re using.
* Trust is built when data is high-quality, its origin and value are understood, and team members know how it can contribute to the goals of the business.
* To start, you need to assess the maturity of your organization’s data culture.
* You and your team can interview leaders and team members.
* You can also observe how people make decisions, how decisions are communicated, and the degree to which data is currently governed and managed.
* It won’t be just one thing that provides a score for your data culture, but a mix of inputs.
* If the conclusion is that your data culture is sufficient for the introduction of a data governance program, you’re in good shape.

# Maturing the Data Culture

* Help leaders communicate the value of data and model the type of behavior that demonstrates that data is a priority. This must include communicating the positive results of using data.
* Provide basic tools and education for data use that include manipulating data, analytics, data cleansing, basic query commands, and visualization. Don’t overlook the remarkable capabilities of common applications such as spreadsheets.
* Do something, even if it’s small, to show progress. A successful data culture doesn’t begin with the deployment of complex, far-reaching solutions. Rather, it can be eased into the organization via basic data-management skills offered in a classroom setting or online.
* Recognize that resistance and frustration are part of the journey. Rather than fighting it, find ways to bring comfort and rewards to team members. At a minimum, provide a channel for feedback and positive discussion.

# Assessing Data Governance Readiness

* The basis of a data culture exists.
* The program is 100 percent aligned with business strategy.
* Senior leadership is 100 percent committed to the program and its goals.
* Senior leadership understands this is a strategic, enterprise program and not the sole responsibility of the IT department.
* One or more sponsors have been identified at an executive level.
* The program has the commitment to fund its creation and to maintain it in the long term.
* The organization understands this is an ongoing program and not a one-off project.
* You have documented the return-on-investment (ROI).
* Legal and compliance teams (internally or externally) understand and support the goals of the program.
* Fundamental data skills exist for the data governance journey.
* The IT organization is capable and resourced to support the program.
* This list is not exhaustive and there may be other items you consider relevant to your organization.

# Defining Data 

* Data refers to collections of digitally stored units, in other words, stuff that is kept on a computing device.
* These units represent something meaningful when processed for a human or a computer.
* Single units of data are traditionally referred to as datum and multiple units as data.
* However, the term data is often used in singular and plural contexts and, in this course, We are going to simply refer to both as data.
* Data is also defined based on its captured format. Specifically, at a high level, it falls into one of the following categories:
* Structured: Data that has been formatted to a set structure; each data unit fits nicely into a table in a database. It’s ready for analysis. Examples include first name, last name, and phone number.
* Unstructured: Data that are stored in a native format must be processed to be used. Further work is required to enable analysis. Examples include email content and social media posts.
* Semi-structured: Data that contains additional information to enable the native format to be searched and analyzed.

# From Data to Insight

* Creating, collecting, and storing data is a waste of time and money if it’s being done without a clear purpose or intent to use it in the future.
* Certain exceptions may be logical to collect data even when we don’t have a reason because it may have value at some point in the future, but this is only an exception.
* Generally, an organization is onboarding data because it’s required for some purpose.

# Data-Driven Decision-Making

* Perhaps one of the greatest values of data is its ability to help us all make better decisions.
* Intuitively reading the customer reviews of a restaurant on a website such as Hello Peter or Google Reviews can help you decide whether you want to eat there.
* It’s valuable to you, but it’s also valuable to the restaurant owner.
* Those reviews can make a big difference, including being a motivation for action. Perhaps the restrooms should be cleaner.
* Deciding on a restaurant based on reviews is an example of data-driven decision-making, but it’s also on the less complex end of the decision-making spectrum.
* Deciding to enter a new market with an existing product or service requires a deep understanding that can come from rich sets of data.
* If the data exists and you have the tools to process and interpret it, you may be well-positioned to make the right decision.
* It may also be easier to decide because you’re able to get the answers to your concerns.
* Conversely, without good data and the skills and tools to analyze it, a bad and costly decision may result. This happens far too often.
* The availability of abundant good quality data has been a boon for decision-making. You should note that I said good-quality data.
* Consider this; if you make a decision based on bad data, your challenges will be entirely different.
* Abundant data is a product of the 21st century, but quality data is the product of deliberate actions.
* Data governance plays a central role when aspiring for data quality. 

# Data as the New Oil

* Just as oil drove and grew economies in the past, data is doing that now.
* Some have subsequently added that just like oil, data has value but must first be processed to be useful. Specifically, oil is refined to make gas, plastics, and other useful chemicals.
* In a similar fashion, data must be organized and analyzed to understand patterns, make decisions, identify problems, and feed other systems.
* Without these additional steps of organizing and analyzing, oil and data are similar in that they are notably messy and unusable in their raw form.
* Like oil, those who control large repositories of high-value data have disproportionate power.

# Data Ownership

* For something to be properly managed, someone needs to be responsible.
* These rights may span from lightweight oversight and control to rigorous rules that are legally enforceable.

# Data Architecture

* When designing the technical needs of an organization to support its business strategy, this practice is known as enterprise architecture (EA).
* Data architecture is a direct reflection of data governance. 
* Using standards and established principles, organizations can analyze, design, plan, and implement the right technologies, policies, and projects to support business goals.
* A subset of EA is data architecture.
* In the same manner, which you can consider the holistic nature of EA in support of the organization’s strategy.
* Data architecture is the manner in which data design and management decisions are being made to align with EA and in turn, with the business.
* Simply stated, data architecture is the agreed blueprint for how data supports an organization’s functions and technologies.
* When high-quality enterprises and data architectures both exist, organizations run more smoothly, and they can transform as conditions (either internally or in the marketplace) dictate.
* The absence or poor implementation of both can stifle digital transformation efforts, create high levels of complexity, and increase the possibility of failure.

# Data Architecture supports the following

* Ensuring data is available to those who need it and are approved to use it.
* Reducing the complexity of accessing and utilizing data.
* Creating and enforcing data protections to support organizational policies and obligations.
* Adopting and agreeing to data standards.
* Optimizing the flow and efficient use of data to eliminate bottlenecks and duplication.
* An established and functioning data architecture immediately signals that an organization values data, manages it as a critical business asset, and has controls in place to ensure that it aligns with business needs.
* Indeed, like EA, data architecture is not the exclusive realm of technologists but a cross-organizational responsibility.
* In most medium to large organizations, data must efficiently flow across business silos, such as sales and product development, and serve many different audiences in multiple forms.   

# The Lifecycle of Data

1. Creation:  This is the stage at which data comes into being. It may be manual or automated and get created internally or externally. Data is created all the time by a vast number of activities that include system inputs and outputs.
2. Storage:  Once data is created and assuming you want it available for later use, it must be stored. It most likely will be contained and managed in a database. The database needs a home, too as a local hard drive, server, or cloud service.
3. Usage:  Hopefully you’re capturing and storing data because you want to use it. Maybe not immediately, but at some point, perhaps for analysis. Data may need to be processed to be useful. That could include cleansing it of errors, transforming it to another format, and securing access rights.
4. Archival:  In this stage, you identify data that is not currently being used and move it to a long-term storage system out of your production environment. If it's needed at some point in the future, it can be retrieved and utilized.
5. Destruction:  Despite a desire by some to keep everything forever, there is a logical point where destruction makes sense or is required by regulation or policy. Data destruction involves making data inaccessible and unreadable. It can include the physical destruction of a device such as a hard drive.

# Understanding the impact of Big Data

* Data isn’t some kind of new phenomenon. In fact, we’ve been capturing and storing data in an analog fashion for thousands of years.
* The Romans, for example, used ledgers to keep track of their various activities across their expansive empire.
* Fast-forward to the 20th century and the Cold War was instrumental in the technological leaps that resulted in microprocessors and the classical computing we use today.
* One by-product of the Cold War, the space race between the United States and the Soviet Union, accelerated innovation in computing and telecommunications.
