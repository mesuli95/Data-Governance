# What is Data Governance

* Data governance is all about managing data well, but data governance is not restricted to only data management.
* Today, when data is managed well, it can drive innovation and growth and can be an enterprise’s most abundant and important lever for success.
* Successful data governance also means that data risks can be minimized, and data compliance and regulatory requirements can be met with ease.
* This can bring important comfort to business leaders who, in some jurisdictions, can now be personally liable for issues arising from poor data management.
* Every organization manages data at some level. All businesses generate, process, use, and store data as a result of their daily operations.
* But there’s a huge difference between businesses that casually manage data and those that consider data to be a valuable asset and treat it accordingly.
* This difference is characterized by the degree to which there are formalities in managing data.

# Data Governance vs Data Management

* Within the EIM space, there are many terms that sound like they might mean the same thing.
* There is often confusion about the difference between data governance and data management.
* Data governance is focused on roles and responsibilities, policies, definitions, metrics, and the lifecycle of data.
* Data management is the technical implementation of data governance.
* For example, databases, data warehouses and lakes, application programming interfaces (APIs), analytics software, encryption, data crunching, and architectural design and implementation are all data management features and functions.

# Data Governance versus Information Governance 

* Similarly, in EIM, you may want clarity on the difference between data governance and information governance.
* Data governance generally focuses on data, independent of its meaning.
* For example, you may want to govern the security of patient data and staff data from a policy and process perspective, despite their differences. The interest here is in the data, not as much in the business context.
* Information governance is entirely concerned with the meaning of the data and its relationship in terms of outcomes and value to the organization, customers, and other stakeholders.
* This shouldn’t present an issue as long as the strategy for data governance is well understood.
* You should understand the context of data, a concept known as data intelligence, and the desired business outcomes, to complement data governance efforts in a valuable manner.

# The value of Data Governance

* Fundamentally, data governance is driven by a desire to increase the value of data and reduce the risks associated with it. It forces a leap from an ad hoc approach to data to one that is strategic in nature.

# Advantages of good data governance

* Improved data quality
* Expanded data value
* Increased data compliance
* Improved data-driven decision-making
* Enhanced business performance
* Greater sharing and use of data across the enterprise and externally
* Increased data availability and accessibility
* Improved data search
* Reduced risks from data-related issues
* Reduced data management costs
* Established rules for handling data
* Any one of these alone is desirable, but a well-executed and maintained data governance program will deliver many of these and more.
* For example, poor-quality data that is not current, inaccurate, and incomplete can lead to operating inefficiencies and poor decision-making.
* Data governance does not emerge by chance. It’s a choice and requires organizational commitment and investment.

# Creating a Data Governance Program

* Defining the vision, goals, and benefits.
* Analyzing the current state of data governance and management.
* Developing a proposal based on the first two steps, including a draft plan.
* Achieving leadership approval.
* Designing and developing the program.
* Implementing the program.
* Monitoring and measuring performance.
* Maintaining the program.
