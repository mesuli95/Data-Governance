# Data Governance

<details>
 <summary> Notes </summary>

# What is Data Governance

* Data governance is all about managing data well, but data governance is not restricted to only data management.
* Today, when data is managed well, it can drive innovation and growth and can be an enterprise’s most abundant and important lever for success.
* Successful data governance also means that data risks can be minimized, and data compliance and regulatory requirements can be met with ease.
* This can bring important comfort to business leaders who, in some jurisdictions, can now be personally liable for issues arising from poor data management.
* Every organization manages data at some level. All businesses generate, process, use, and store data as a result of their daily operations.
* But there’s a huge difference between businesses that casually manage data and those that consider data to be a valuable asset and treat it accordingly.
* This difference is characterized by the degree to which there are formalities in managing data.

# Data Governance vs Data Management

* Within the EIM space, there are many terms that sound like they might mean the same thing.
* There is often confusion about the difference between data governance and data management.
* Data governance is focused on roles and responsibilities, policies, definitions, metrics, and the lifecycle of data.
* Data management is the technical implementation of data governance.
* For example, databases, data warehouses and lakes, application programming interfaces (APIs), analytics software, encryption, data crunching, and architectural design and implementation are all data management features and functions.

# Data Governance versus Information Governance 

* Similarly, in EIM, you may want clarity on the difference between data governance and information governance.
* Data governance generally focuses on data, independent of its meaning.
* For example, you may want to govern the security of patient data and staff data from a policy and process perspective, despite their differences. The interest here is in the data, not as much in the business context.
* Information governance is entirely concerned with the meaning of the data and its relationship in terms of outcomes and value to the organization, customers, and other stakeholders.
* This shouldn’t present an issue as long as the strategy for data governance is well understood.
* You should understand the context of data, a concept known as data intelligence, and the desired business outcomes, to complement data governance efforts in a valuable manner.

# The value of Data Governance

* Fundamentally, data governance is driven by a desire to increase the value of data and reduce the risks associated with it. It forces a leap from an ad hoc approach to data to one that is strategic in nature.

# Advantages of good data governance

* Improved data quality
* Expanded data value
* Increased data compliance
* Improved data-driven decision-making
* Enhanced business performance
* Greater sharing and use of data across the enterprise and externally
* Increased data availability and accessibility
* Improved data search
* Reduced risks from data-related issues
* Reduced data management costs
* Established rules for handling data
* Any one of these alone is desirable, but a well-executed and maintained data governance program will deliver many of these and more.
* For example, poor-quality data that is not current, inaccurate, and incomplete can lead to operating inefficiencies and poor decision-making.
* Data governance does not emerge by chance. It’s a choice and requires organizational commitment and investment.

# Creating a Data Governance Program

* Defining the vision, goals, and benefits.
* Analyzing the current state of data governance and management.
* Developing a proposal based on the first two steps, including a draft plan.
* Achieving leadership approval.
* Designing and developing the program.
* Implementing the program.
* Monitoring and measuring performance.
* Maintaining the program.
* Data governance is about managing data well and helping to deliver its optimum value to your organization. It includes ensuring your data is available, usable, and secure.

# Developing a Data Governance Framework

* While there are many framework variations to choose from, including ISACA’s Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies (COBIT) IT governance framework, they share some common components that address people, processes, and technology.

# Leadership and Strategy

* Your data governance program must be aligned with the strategy of the organization.
*  For example, how can data governance support the role that data plays in enabling growth in specific markets?
* Data plays a role in many aspects of organizational strategy, including risk management, innovation, and operational efficiencies, so you must ensure there’s a clear alignment between these aspects and the goals of data governance.

# Roles and Responsibilities

* Your data governance program will only be possible with the right people doing the right things at the right time.
* Every data governance framework includes the identification and assignment of specific roles and responsibilities, which range from the information technology (IT) team to data stewards.

# Policies, Processes and Standards

* At the heart of every data governance program are the policies, processes, and standards that guide responsibilities and support uniformity across the organization.
* Each of these must be designed, developed, and deployed. Depending on the size and complexity of the organization, this can take significant effort.
* Policies, processes, and standards must include accountability and enforcement components; otherwise it’s possible they will be dead on arrival.

# Metrics

* The data governance program must have a mechanism to measure whether it is delivering the expected results.
* Capturing metrics and delivering them to a variety of stakeholders is important for maintaining support, which includes funding.
* You’ll want to know if your efforts are delivering on the promise of the program.
* Based on the metrics, you and your team can make continuous improvements (or make radical changes) to ensure that the program is producing value.

# Tools

* Based on the metrics, you and your team can make continuous improvements (or make radical changes) to ensure that the program is producing value.
* These include tools for master data management, data catalogs, search, security, integration, analytics, and compliance.
* In recent years, many data science-related tools have made leaps in terms of incorporating ease-of-use and automation.
* What used to be complex has been democratized and empowered more team members to better manage and derive value from data.

# Communication and Collaroration

* With the introduction of data governance and the ongoing, sometimes evolving, requirements, high-quality communications are key.
* This takes many forms, including in-person meetings, emails, newsletters, and workshops.
* Change management, in particular, requires careful attention to ensure that impacted team members understand how the changes brought about by the data governance program affect them and their obligations.
* A large number of disparate stakeholders need to work together in order to effectively govern data.
* It also requires clear channels between teams, such as regular meetings. Online collaboration platforms are increasingly being used too.

# Preparing for Data Governance

* Data governance requires careful treatment, beginning with understanding whether an organization is ready to accept it.
* As the following sections make clear, there are some traps that you can avoid if you and your team are diligent.
* Being ready as an organization involves determining the extent to which a data culture exists.
* Intuitively you can conclude that an immature, reactive data culture, where data is simply handled in an ad hoc manner, is an entirely different experience than a sophisticated data-driven culture.
* There are other prerequisites for data governance success. These include ensuring that the organization’s strategy is fully aligned with the proposed program.
* As mentioned, any misalignment here is the number one reason data governance program deployments fail.

# Data Culture

* Many well-designed projects and initiatives fall flat and fail even though their teams seem to have done everything right.
* Too often, the work gets deployed into an environment that is either not ready for change or doesn’t have the optimum conditions for success.
* Culture will always defeat the greatest of strategies almost every time. Imagine for a moment designing and deploying a data governance program for an organization that has little or no data culture.
* Intuitively this sounds like a disaster in the making. To be fair, every organization has some form of a data culture; it just might not be in an ideal state.

# Assessing the Data Culture 

* If you want to increase your chances of success - you need to understand the data culture of your organization and determine how to broaden and mature it if necessary.
* You need an environment for success.
* On a basic level, data culture is how your organization values data and how it manages and uses it.
* There’s a wide chasm between companies that simply manage data as a consequence of doing business versus those that consider data central to how their organization operates and makes decisions
* Effective data cultures support and empower all employees, from the newest intern to the CEO, to access and use meaningful and timely data for their work.
* Such cultures ensure that employees have attained the skills they need to use data analytics and can make good data-driven decisions.
* It’s not an overstatement to say that these types of organizations are often defined by their enlightened and competitive use of data.
* In a data culture, decisions don’t rely on gut feelings, guesses, or the opinion of the highest-paid/ranking person in the room. Rather, decisions are based on data and the insights they can produce.
* In a world undergoing rapid digital transformation, data is the metaphorical oil that is powering and enabling it all.
* To be competitive, a progressive data-driven strategy is no longer optional. It’s a central concern. Data culture can be now considered a new way of doing business in the digital age.
* Leaders in all types of organizations are recognizing that to succeed in the third decade of the 21st century and beyond, they must leverage the enormous power and value of data.
* This acknowledgment, and the actions that senior leaders take to foster the use of data, is the primary success factor in the development and maturity of an effective data culture.
* Trust comes in a close second. This means that team members will only make data-driven decisions if they trust the data they’re using.
* Trust is built when data is high-quality, its origin and value are understood, and team members know how it can contribute to the goals of the business.
* To start, you need to assess the maturity of your organization’s data culture.
* You and your team can interview leaders and team members.
* You can also observe how people make decisions, how decisions are communicated, and the degree to which data is currently governed and managed.
* It won’t be just one thing that provides a score for your data culture, but a mix of inputs.
* If the conclusion is that your data culture is sufficient for the introduction of a data governance program, you’re in good shape.

# Maturing the Data Culture

* Help leaders communicate the value of data and model the type of behavior that demonstrates that data is a priority. This must include communicating the positive results of using data.
* Provide basic tools and education for data use that include manipulating data, analytics, data cleansing, basic query commands, and visualization. Don’t overlook the remarkable capabilities of common applications such as spreadsheets.
* Do something, even if it’s small, to show progress. A successful data culture doesn’t begin with the deployment of complex, far-reaching solutions. Rather, it can be eased into the organization via basic data-management skills offered in a classroom setting or online.
* Recognize that resistance and frustration are part of the journey. Rather than fighting it, find ways to bring comfort and rewards to team members. At a minimum, provide a channel for feedback and positive discussion.

# Assessing Data Governance Readiness

* The basis of a data culture exists.
* The program is 100 percent aligned with business strategy.
* Senior leadership is 100 percent committed to the program and its goals.
* Senior leadership understands this is a strategic, enterprise program and not the sole responsibility of the IT department.
* One or more sponsors have been identified at an executive level.
* The program has the commitment to fund its creation and to maintain it in the long term.
* The organization understands this is an ongoing program and not a one-off project.
* You have documented the return-on-investment (ROI).
* Legal and compliance teams (internally or externally) understand and support the goals of the program.
* Fundamental data skills exist for the data governance journey.
* The IT organization is capable and resourced to support the program.
* This list is not exhaustive and there may be other items you consider relevant to your organization.

# Defining Data 

* Data refers to collections of digitally stored units, in other words, stuff that is kept on a computing device.
* These units represent something meaningful when processed for a human or a computer.
* Single units of data are traditionally referred to as datum and multiple units as data.
* However, the term data is often used in singular and plural contexts and, in this course, We are going to simply refer to both as data.
* Data is also defined based on its captured format. Specifically, at a high level, it falls into one of the following categories:
* Structured: Data that has been formatted to a set structure; each data unit fits nicely into a table in a database. It’s ready for analysis. Examples include first name, last name, and phone number.
* Unstructured: Data that are stored in a native format must be processed to be used. Further work is required to enable analysis. Examples include email content and social media posts.
* Semi-structured: Data that contains additional information to enable the native format to be searched and analyzed.

# From Data to Insight

* Creating, collecting, and storing data is a waste of time and money if it’s being done without a clear purpose or intent to use it in the future.
* Certain exceptions may be logical to collect data even when we don’t have a reason because it may have value at some point in the future, but this is only an exception.
* Generally, an organization is onboarding data because it’s required for some purpose.

# The role of Data in the 21st Century

* Since the early days of data processing in the 19th and 20th centuries right through to digital transformation in the 21st century, data has played many important roles.
* It’s helped us understand the world in completely new ways, improved our ability to make better-informed decisions, and supported our efforts to solve all manner of problems. In this way, it’s fair to say that data has always been important.
* Something is quite clear though. The value data that has been added over the course of many decades has not remained flat.
* In these early decades of the 21st century, we are producing more data than we can handle, and the depth, breadth, and quality of the data that is being used are reshaping not just the tools and capabilities of our industries and cities, but the nature of how we learn, socialize, and entertain ourselves.
*  It’s also elevating risks that we may previously have characterized as annoyances to a world today where a cyberattack can result in millions of dollars of losses in hours.

# Data-Driven Decision-Making

* Perhaps one of the greatest values of data is its ability to help us all make better decisions.
* Intuitively reading the customer reviews of a restaurant on a website such as Hello Peter or Google Reviews can help you decide whether you want to eat there.
* It’s valuable to you, but it’s also valuable to the restaurant owner.
* Those reviews can make a big difference, including being a motivation for action. Perhaps the restrooms should be cleaner.
* Deciding on a restaurant based on reviews is an example of data-driven decision-making, but it’s also on the less complex end of the decision-making spectrum.
* Deciding to enter a new market with an existing product or service requires a deep understanding that can come from rich sets of data.
* If the data exists and you have the tools to process and interpret it, you may be well-positioned to make the right decision.
* It may also be easier to decide because you’re able to get the answers to your concerns.
* Conversely, without good data and the skills and tools to analyze it, a bad and costly decision may result. This happens far too often.
* The availability of abundant good quality data has been a boon for decision-making. You should note that I said good-quality data.
* Consider this; if you make a decision based on bad data, your challenges will be entirely different.
* Abundant data is a product of the 21st century, but quality data is the product of deliberate actions.
* Data governance plays a central role when aspiring for data quality. 

# Data as the New Oil

* Just as oil drove and grew economies in the past, data is doing that now.
* Some have subsequently added that just like oil, data has value but must first be processed to be useful. Specifically, oil is refined to make gas, plastics, and other useful chemicals.
* In a similar fashion, data must be organized and analyzed to understand patterns, make decisions, identify problems, and feed other systems.
* Without these additional steps of organizing and analyzing, oil and data are similar in that they are notably messy and unusable in their raw form.
* Like oil, those who control large repositories of high-value data have disproportionate power.

# Data Ownership

* For something to be properly managed, someone needs to be responsible.
* These rights may span from lightweight oversight and control to rigorous rules that are legally enforceable.

# Data Architecture

* When designing the technical needs of an organization to support its business strategy, this practice is known as enterprise architecture (EA).
* Data architecture is a direct reflection of data governance. 
* Using standards and established principles, organizations can analyze, design, plan, and implement the right technologies, policies, and projects to support business goals.
* A subset of EA is data architecture.
* In the same manner, which you can consider the holistic nature of EA in support of the organization’s strategy.
* Data architecture is the manner in which data design and management decisions are being made to align with EA and in turn, with the business.
* Simply stated, data architecture is the agreed blueprint for how data supports an organization’s functions and technologies.
* When high-quality enterprises and data architectures both exist, organizations run more smoothly, and they can transform as conditions (either internally or in the marketplace) dictate.
* The absence or poor implementation of both can stifle digital transformation efforts, create high levels of complexity, and increase the possibility of failure.

# Data Architecture supports the following

* Ensuring data is available to those who need it and are approved to use it.
* Reducing the complexity of accessing and utilizing data.
* Creating and enforcing data protections to support organizational policies and obligations.
* Adopting and agreeing to data standards.
* Optimizing the flow and efficient use of data to eliminate bottlenecks and duplication.
* An established and functioning data architecture immediately signals that an organization values data, manages it as a critical business asset, and has controls in place to ensure that it aligns with business needs.
* Indeed, like EA, data architecture is not the exclusive realm of technologists but a cross-organizational responsibility.
* In most medium to large organizations, data must efficiently flow across business silos, such as sales and product development, and serve many different audiences in multiple forms.   

# The Lifecycle of Data

1. Creation:  This is the stage at which data comes into being. It may be manual or automated and get created internally or externally. Data is created all the time by a vast number of activities that include system inputs and outputs.
2. Storage:  Once data is created and assuming you want it available for later use, it must be stored. It most likely will be contained and managed in a database. The database needs a home, too as a local hard drive, server, or cloud service.
3. Usage:  Hopefully you’re capturing and storing data because you want to use it. Maybe not immediately, but at some point, perhaps for analysis. Data may need to be processed to be useful. That could include cleansing it of errors, transforming it to another format, and securing access rights.
4. Archival:  In this stage, you identify data that is not currently being used and move it to a long-term storage system out of your production environment. If it's needed at some point in the future, it can be retrieved and utilized.
5. Destruction:  Despite a desire by some to keep everything forever, there is a logical point where destruction makes sense or is required by regulation or policy. Data destruction involves making data inaccessible and unreadable. It can include the physical destruction of a device such as a hard drive.

# Understanding the impact of Big Data

* Data isn’t some kind of new phenomenon. In fact, we’ve been capturing and storing data in an analog fashion for thousands of years.
* The Romans, for example, used ledgers to keep track of their various activities across their expansive empire.
* Fast-forward to the 20th century and the Cold War was instrumental in the technological leaps that resulted in microprocessors and the classical computing we use today.
* One by-product of the Cold War, the space race between the United States and the Soviet Union, accelerated innovation in computing and telecommunications.

# The Role of the U.S Census in The Information Revolution

* Processing data on some form of computing device has been around since the late 1800s. In fact, the need for a mechanism to better tabulate the results of the U.S.
* Constitutional requirement to conduct a population census every ten years is said to be the origin of data processing.
* Counting all the people and other data points in the 1880 census took almost eight years.
* It’s assumed it was full of errors. It was also a boring, tedious process.
* Credit for the first company to automate and commercialize the processing of this data goes to the Tabulating Machine Company, founded in 1896.

# Difining Big Data

* Big data is structured and unstructured data that is so massive and complex in scale, that it’s difficult and often impossible to process via traditional data management techniques.

# One way to define and characterize big data is through these five Vs:

* Volume: The sheer scale of data being produced is unprecedented and requires new tools, skills, and processes.
* Variety: There are already a lot of legacy file formats, such as CSV and MP3, and with new innovations, new formats are emerging all the time. This requires different methods of handling, from analysis to security.
* Velocity: With so many collection points, digital interfaces, and ubiquitous connectivity, data is being created and moved at increasing speed. Consider that in 2021, Instagram users created, * uploaded, and share 65,000 pictures a minute.
* Variability:  The fact that the creation and flow of data are unpredictable.
* Veracity:  The quality, including accuracy and truthfulness, of large volume of disparate sets of data, can differ considerably, causing challenges to data management.

# Drivers of Big Data

* At a technology conference in 2003, the then-CEO of Google, Eric Schmidt. At the time said that every two days the world was creating more data than all the data created since the dawn of civilization.
* Big data was a thing even before Android and Apple smartphones and apps started generating data.
* This was before we had connected billions of devices, called the Internet of Things (IoTs), which would eventually begin collecting all manner of data.
* Big data even predates videos of cats published every day on social media platforms.
* By the third decade of the 21st century, with so many devices connected and the world in a state of digital transformation, the volume of data being created had experienced a Cambrian explosion.
* Cambrian explosion — a term the data science community has adopted from an early period in history notable for the rapid introduction of life into the natural environment.
* We were regularly well into the zettabyte range of data and its growth curve was continuing relentlessly.
* In 2021, global technology use generated 79 zettabytes of data, and it is anticipated to hit 180 zettabytes in 2025.
* A learner seeing this course in 2040 might read the previous sentence and not be impressed at such small numbers, the same way a 32GB smartphone was considered a large amount of space in 2015.

# Consequences of Big Data

* While these big data statistics are impressive, they don’t really paint the full picture. It might be easy, for example, to assume that all the data is good quality. You might believe it is easy to analyze.
* You may even think it is easily accessible. Most of these assumptions and many related ones will likely be incorrect.
* For starters, up to 80 percent of data is unstructured.
* That’s a challenge right there. The vast majority of organizations struggle with unstructured data.
* In addition, a lot of this data is duplicative. Some of it will be bad data, which means it can’t be trusted, has errors, or includes some other substantive challenge.
* An over-used quote attributed to the 19th century U.S. retailer John Wanamaker stated that half his advertising budget was wasted but he just didn’t know which half.
* In a time when advertising was mainly billboards and newspapers, it was nearly impossible to know which advertising resulted in a sale.
* Today, a combination of hyperconnectivity and data has upended this predicament. Marketers using the latest technology can better understand the marketplace in granular detail.
* They can target specific audiences, and even specific individuals, where the chance of a sale is highest.

# What about small data?

* While so many of our business activities in the digital economy are driven by big data, there are still a lot of small data sets that are instrumental in decision-making and day-to-day operations.
* Think about all the spreadsheets that come by your inbox, the short surveys, or those go-to lists that we’ve all compiled and can’t live without.
* It’s not nearly as glamorous as big data, but in some cases, it may be argued as valuable.
* Big questions can be answered in small data.
* In fact, big data is often more meaningful when broken into smaller, more manageable chunks.
* chunks - an increasingly popular definition of small data. Smaller, logically arranged data can be the way to make sense of big data.
* In some circumstances, it may be the only way.

# Enter the Realm of Smart Data 

* Smart data has emerged as a new term that defines big data that’s been optimally prepared for use to deliver the highest business value.
* Instead of being overwhelmed by the distractions inherent to the volume, velocity, and variety of data in big data sets, processes are applied to big data to prepare it for specific uses.
* For example, marketing teams can target potential customers with precision. Analytics applications can use high-quality real-time data generated in a manufacturing setting.
* Smart data uses new processes and tools to make the data most useful.
* For example, the increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) is now being applied to find patterns in unstructured big data and extract the data that is most relevant for a given application.
* Using new methods such as AI reduces time, lowers errors, and enables the creation of data subsets that may not have been previously possible.
* In addition, smart data solutions are often applied at the point of collection rather than a post-processing solution.
* In the 21st century we must recognize that all data can have value — big, small, and smart. Data governance is concerned with data no matter what form it takes.

# Identifying the Roles of Data 

* To fully appreciate the value that data brings to every organization, it’s worth exploring the many ways that data shows up on a daily basis.
* Recognizing the incredible diversity of data use and the exposure it has across all business functions reinforces its importance.
* It's critical to ensure that data is high quality, secure, compliant, and accessible to the right people at the right time.
* Data isn’t something that just concerns the data analytics team or the information technology department. It’s also not something that is limited to decision-makers and leaders.

# Operations 

* Business operations concern themselves with a diverse set of activities to run the day-to-day needs and drive the mission of an organization.
* Each business has different needs, and operational functions reflect these specific requirements. Some core functions show up in almost every organization.
* Consider payroll, order management, and marketing. At the same time, some operational support won’t be required.
* Not every organization needs its own IT organization, or if it’s a service business, it may not have a warehouse.
* Operations run on and are powered by a variety of data and information sources. They also create a lot of both, too.
* The performance of operations is often easily quantified by data.
* For example, in a human resources (HR) function, they’ll want to know how many openings there are, how long openings are taking to fill, and who is accepting offers.
* There’s a multitude of data points to quantify the answers to these so that relevant decisions can be made.
* In HR, data is also created by the activities of the function.
* For example, candidates enter data when they apply for a position, data is entered when evaluating an applicant, and all along the way the supporting systems log a variety of automated data, such as time, date, and how long an application took to complete online.
* Operations use data to make decisions, enable systems to run, and deliver data to internal and external entities. For example, a regional sales team will deliver their monthly results to headquarters to be presented to vice presidents or the C-suite.
* Many data functions in support operations are automated. For example, a warehouse inventory system may automatically generate a replenishment order when stock drops to a certain level.
* Consider all the notifications that systems generate based on triggers. Who hasn’t received an email notifying them that they haven’t submitted their time and expense report?

# Strategy

* Every organization has a strategy, whether it’s articulated overtly or not. At the organizational level, this is about creating a plan that supports objectives and goals.
*  It’s essentially about understanding the challenges to delivering on the organization’s purpose and then agreeing on the proposed solutions to those challenges.
* Strategy can also be adopted at the department and division levels, but the intent is the same: understand the journey ahead and make a plan.
* Strategy leads to implementation and requires the support of operations to realize its goals. In this way, strategy and operations are two sides of the same coin.
*  Done right, a data-driven strategy delivered with operational excellence can be a winning ticket.
* Creating a strategy typically comes down to a core set of activities. It begins with an analysis of the environment followed by some conclusions on what has been gathered.
* Finally, a plan is developed, driven by some form of guiding principles. These principles may be derived from the nature of the work, the values of the founders, or some other factors.
* Deeply tied to all these steps is the availability of good quality data that can be processed and analyzed and then turned into actionable insights.
* Certainly, data and information won’t be the only mechanisms in which the plan will be constructed.
* There must be room for other perspectives, including the strength of belief that people with experience bring to the discussion.
* The right mix of data and non-data sources must be considered. Too much of one or the other may not deliver the expected results.
* A best practice for strategy development is to consider it an ongoing process.
* This doesn’t mean updating the strategy every month — as strategies are intended to last for several years — but it may mean revisiting the strategy every six months and tweaking it as necessary.
* Revisions to strategy should be guided by new data, which can mean new knowledge and new insights.
* While a regular process of strategy revisions is encouraged, new information that suddenly presents itself can trigger an impromptu update.
* In the 21st century, organizations need to react quickly to environmental conditions to survive. Data will form the backbone of your response system.

# Decision-Making

* It’s generally accepted in business that the highest form of value derived from data is the ability to make better-informed decisions.
* Without even creating a single unit of raw data, there’s a universe of existing data and information at our fingertips
* In addition, increasing numbers of easy-to-use analysis capabilities and tools are democratizing access to insight.
* Popular consumer search engines such as Google and Bing have transformed how we make decisions.
* Doctors, for example, now deal with patients who are more informed about their symptoms and their causes
* Within organizations, access to abundant data and information has resulted in quicker, timeous, and better-quality business decisions.
* For example, executives can understand their strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats closer to real time.
* For most, gone are the days of waiting until the end of the fiscal quarter to get the good or bad news.
* Even if the information is tentative in the interim, it’s vastly better than being in the dark until it may be too late.
* While there’s little surprise that data-driven decision-making is a fundamental business competency, it all hinges on decision-makers getting access to quality data at the right time.
* Abundant and out-of-date data are not synonymous with data value. Bad data may be worse than no data.
* Bad data processed into information and then used as the basis for decisions will result in failure.
* The outcome of decisions based on bad data could range from a minor mistake to job termination right up to the closing of the business.

# Measuring

* Organizations are in a continuous state of measurement, whether it’s overt or tacit. Every observed unit of data contributes to building a picture of the business.
* The often-used adage, what gets measured gets managed, is generally applicable. That said, some things are hard to measure and not everything gets measured.
* The aspiration for every leader is that they have the information they need when they need it.
* You might not always think of it this way, but that information is going to be derived from data that is a result of some form of measurement.
* Data measurements can be quantitative or qualitative.
* Quantitative data is most often described in numerical terms, whereas qualitative data is descriptive and expressed in terms of language.
* The type of information desired directly correlates to the measurement approach.
* This is going to inform your choices of at least what, when, where, and how data is captured.
* A general rule is only to capture and measure what matters.
* Some may argue that capturing data now to measure later has value even if there isn’t a good case yet.
* I can buy that but be careful with your limited resources and the potential costs.
* “Not everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted.”
* This quote teaches us that being overly passionate to believe that you can always find relevance in any type of data, be the mere fact that you can identify data elements.

# Monitoring

* This is an ongoing process of collecting and evaluating the performance of, say, a project, process, system, or another item of interest.
* Often the results collected are compared against some existing values or desired targets.
* For example, a machine on a factory floor may be expected to produce 100 widgets per hour.
* You engage in some manner of monitoring in order to inform whether, in fact, this expectation is being met.
* Across a wide range of activities, monitoring also helps to ensure the continuity, stability, and reliability of that being supervised.
* The data produced through monitoring feeds reports, real-time systems, and software-based dashboards.
* A monitor can tell you how much power is left in your smartphone, whether an employee is spending all their time on social media, or if through predictive maintenance, a production line is about to fail.
* Monitoring is another process that converts data into insight and as such, exists as a mechanism to guide decisions.
* The role of data in measurement and monitoring often go hand-in-hand.
* Intuitively you know you have to measure something that you want to monitor.
* The takeaway here is not the obvious relationship they have, but the fact that data is a type of connective tissue that binds business functions.
* This interdependence requires oversight and controls, as stakeholders often have different responsibilities and permissions.
* For example, the people responsible for providing measurement data on processes may belong to an entirely different team from those who have to monitor and report on the measurement data.
* Those who take action may again belong to an entirely different department in the organization.
* Data monitoring is also the process of evaluating the quality of data and determining if it is fit for purpose.
* To achieve this, it requires processes, technologies, and benchmarks.
* Data quality monitoring metrics may include areas such as completeness and accuracy.
* By continuously monitoring the quality of the data in your organization, opportunities and issues may be revealed in a timely manner.
* Then, if deemed appropriate, actions can be prioritized.

# Insight Management

* Data forms the building blocks of many business functions.
* In support of decision-making — arguably its most important value — data is the source for almost all insight.
* As a basic definition, business insight is sometimes referred to as information that can make a difference.
* It’s not enough to simply collect lots of data and expect that insight will suddenly emerge. There must be an attendant management process.
* Thus, insight management means ensuring that data and information are capable of delivering insight.
* Insight management begins with gathering and analyzing data from different sources.
* In order to determine what data to process, those responsible for insight management must deeply understand the organization’s information needs.
* They must be knowledgeable about what data has value. In addition, these analysts must know how information flows across the organization and who it must reach.
* With the data gathered and processed, analytics will be applied — this is the interpretation of the data and its implications.
* Insight management involves designing and creating the most effective manner to communicate any findings.
* For different audiences, different mechanisms may be required.
* This is seldom a one-size-fits-all. Some people will want an executive summary while others may want the painful details.
* For an insight to be most valuable, it must be the right information, at the right time, in the right format, for the right people. But this in general is no simple task.

# Reporting

* Perhaps the most obvious manifestation of data and information management in any organization is the use of reports.
* Creating, delivering, receiving, and acting on reports are fundamental functions of any organization.
* Some say they are the backbone of every business.
* That sounds overly glamorous, but it does speak to the importance of reporting and reports.
* The content of a report, which can be summarized or detailed, contains data and information in a structured manner.
* For example, an expenditure report would provide a basic overview of the purpose of the report and then support it with relevant information.
* That could include a list of all expenditures for a department over a certain period or it could just be a total amount. It will depend on the audience and purpose. The inclusion of visuals is popular.
* Reports are typically online or physical presentations of data and information on some aspect of an organization.
* With so many uses of data and information, the purpose of reporting is largely about improved decision-making.
* With the right information, in the right format, at the right time, business leaders are empowered to make better decisions, solve problems, and communicate plans and policies.
* While reports do empower leaders and give them more tools, they don’t guarantee the right decisions.
* Knowing something is not the equivalent of making the right choices at the right time.

# Other Roles for Data

* While we’ve gone over a number of the most visible uses of data in organizations today, it was not the intent to list every conceivable way that data is used.


# Important areas that we should not omit

* Artificial intelligence (AI):  Data is considered the fuel of AI. It requires a high volume of good data. With huge quantities of quality data, the outcomes of AI improve. It’s from the data that AI learns patterns, identifies relationships, and determines probabilities. In addition, AI is being used to improve the quality and use of data in organizations.
* Problem-solving:  Acknowledging the close association with decision-making, it’s worth calling out problem-solving as a distinctive use of data. Data plays a role in how a problem is defined, determining what solutions are available, evaluating which solution to use, and measuring the success or failure of the solution that is chosen and applied.
* Data reuse:  While we collect and use data for a specific primary purpose, data is often reused for entirely different reasons. Data that has been collected, used, and stored can be retrieved and used by a different team at another time - assuming they have permission, including access and legal rights (notable controls within data governance). Data reuse can be considered a positive given that it reduces data collection duplication and increases the value of data to an organization, but it must be managed with care so that it doesn’t break any data use rules

# Improving Outcomes with Data

* Now that the diverse roles of data have been identified and discussed, it’s useful to understand how data can be leveraged to acquire its maximum value. It begins with recognizing that data is an organizational asset.
* This simply means that it’s something that brings economic value to the organization.
*  It’s clear to see this when it is pointed out, but many team members don’t yet look at data this way.
* When data is considered an asset - in fact, specifically a high-value asset - it often gets treated differently.
* Perhaps the function that is most associated with data is the process of exploring it and looking for insights.
* Called data analytics, this is a comprehensive organizational function that requires skilled staff and tools.
* With the emergence of big data, data analytics has become more complex and requires deeper skills, but it’s also made data more valuable and important to the business.

# Approaching Data as an Asset

* An asset is something that is owned by a person, an organization, or a government with the expectation that it can bring some economic benefit.
* This includes the generation of income, the reduction of expenses, or an increase in net worth.
* An asset can be tangible or intangible. Tangible assets are physical things such as inventory, machines, and property. That’s stuff you can see and touch.
* An intangible asset is the opposite; it’s a non-physical thing like software, copyrights, a brand, and goodwill. Data is an intangible asset.
* Organizations care about both types of assets because they typically get captured in their financial accounts.
* Listing the value of assets presents the true state of any organization and reflects its financial health.
* In addition, capturing and valuing assets is required for determining tax obligations and for acquiring loans.

# Examples of the economic value of data:

* Improves operations.
* Increases existing revenue.
* Produces new forms of revenue.
* Builds relationships with customers and other stakeholders.
* Improves the quality of products and services.
* Contributes to competitive advantage.
* Enables innovation.
* Reduces risk.

* It’s notable that data isn’t typically captured overtly on an organization's balance sheet.
* The net result of knowing that data is an asset, but not treating it the same way as other financial assets, means it often doesn’t get the attention and respect it deserves.
* In practical terms, this may mean that data is often taken for granted, not leveraged nearly as much as it could be, and not protected to the extent it must be.
* Recognizing that data is an asset is the first step to good data governance.
* When you think of data as an asset, you’ll be concerned with whether it is good or bad data. You’ll pay attention to the data’s accuracy, completeness, validity, and more.
* It means the organization will be mindful of whether data is being used as an organizational resource or being hidden in silos.
* This will mean understanding how the data is being managed and who has responsibility for it. Without roles and accountabilities, data can’t truly be managed well.
* Bottom line: Data is an asset and for its value to be leveraged, it must be governed. This may be one of the most important motivations for good data governance.

# Data Analytics

* The process of examining data in order to produce answers or find conclusions is called data analytics.
* A formal and disciplined approach is conducted by a data analyst, and it’s a necessary step for any individual or organization that’s trying to make good decisions for their organization.
* The process of data analytics is varied depending on resources and context but generally follows the steps outlined in Figure 8. These steps commence after the problem and questions have been identified.

# Basic Steps in Data Analysis

1. Data mining - identifying and extracting relevant data from data sources.
2. Data Mining - sizable effort including removing errors and duplicate data in preparing of data analysis.
3. Statistical analysis - using statistical methods and artificial intelligence to interpret results and develop insights.
4. Data presentation - Communicating results using a variety of techniques including visualization and story telling.

# Data analytics types

* Descriptive:  Existing data sets of historical data are accessed, and analysis is performed to determine what the data tells stakeholders about the performance of a key performance indicator (KPI) or other business objectives. It is insight on past performance.
* Diagnostic:  As the term suggests, this analysis tries to glean from the data the answer to why something happened. It takes descriptive analysis and looks at the cause.
* Predictive:  In this approach, the analyst uses techniques to determine what may occur in the future. It applies tools and techniques to historical data and trends to predict the likelihood of certain outcomes.
* Prescriptive:  This analysis focuses on what action should be taken. In combination with predictive analytics, prescriptive techniques provide estimates of the probabilities of a variety of future outcomes.

* Data analytics involves the use of a variety of software tools depending on the needs, complexities, and skills of the analyst.
* Beyond your favorite spreadsheet program, which can deliver a lot of capabilities, data analysts use products such as R, Python, Tableau, Power BI, QlikView, and others.

# Data Management 

* Data management is not the same as data governance! But they work closely together to deliver results in the use of enterprise data.
* Data governance concerns itself with, for example, defining the roles, policies, controls, and processes for increasing the quality and value of organizational data.
* Data management is the implementation of data governance. Without data management, data governance is just wishful thinking. To get value from data, there must be execution.
* At some level, all organizations implement data management. If you collect and store data, technically you’re managing that data.
* What matters in data management is the degree of sophistication that is applied to managing the value and quality of data sets.
* If it’s on the low side, data may be a bottleneck rather than an advantage.
* Poor data management often results in data silos across an organization, security and compliance issues, errors in data sets, and overall low confidence in the quality of data.

# Good Data Management

* On the other hand, good data management can result in more success in the marketplace.
* When data is handled and treated as a valuable enterprise asset: insights are richer and timelier, operations run smoother, and team members have what they need to make more informed decisions.
* Well-executed data management can translate to reduced data security breaches, and lower compliance, regulatory, and privacy issues.
* Data management processes involve the collection, storage, organization, maintenance, and analytics of an organization’s data.
* It includes the architecture of technology systems such that data can flow across the enterprise and be accessed whenever and by whom it is approved for use.
* Additionally, responsibilities will likely include such areas as data standardization, encryption, and archiving.
* Technology team members have elevated roles in all these activities, but all business stakeholders have some level of data responsibilities, such as compliance with data policies and with realizing data value.
* In summary, good data management provides the opportunity for significantly enhanced organizational performance.

# Governing Data

* Governing data means that some level of control exists to support a related policy.
* For example, an organization may decide that to reduce risk, there needs to be a policy that requires data to be backed up every day.
* The control would be the documentation of the process and enforcement of that policy.
* If, in the review of policy adherence, data wasn’t getting backed up, then you’d quickly know that governance, for whatever reason, was not working.
* To fully realize the potential of data in your organization means that data must be governed.
* Any time an organizational resource or asset is left unmanaged, it’s either a recipe for disaster or a missed opportunity.
* Even a small amount of governance beats no governance every single day.

# The success of governing data can be reduced to three essential factors:

* People:  While recognizing that data is increasingly created and used exclusively by machines without human intervention, handling and benefiting from data is still a highly people-centric exercise. Even in a machine-centric context, it’s people who are most often defining, designing, and maintaining data use. n governing data, people are the subject matter experts, they are responsible for quality, and they oversee and manage all related processes and responsibilities.
* Policies:  A data policy contains a set of adopted rules by an organization that apply to the handling of data in specific conditions and for particular desired outcomes. These policies apply in areas such as quality, privacy, retention, and security. The number of policies is typically a reflection of the size of the organization, the industry, and the degree to which data is considered a high-priority asset. As you can imagine, the healthcare and financial industries, for example, which manage high volumes of sensitive data, have a significant number of data policies in support of their data governance programs.
* Metrics:  It’s largely true, what gets measured gets managed. In developing policies in support of data governance, you have to consider how each is measured. For example, if a policy states that there shouldn’t be more than five risk events per month such as a regulatory requirement being out of compliance, then, assuming the metric is high to begin with, it should decrease over time. If it doesn’t decrease or it does and then fluctuates widely, there’s an issue with the relevant data management procedures. Metrics must be in support of both technical and business needs. 

# Examining the Broader Value of Data

* In small organizations or when a business is first created, only a few systems are used, and team members know the type and location of most of the data that is available.
* The ability of team members to access data that they need for their work, without having to rely on specialists, is called data democratization.
* As organizations grow and more systems are employed, eventually no single person knows what data is available and where it is in the enterprise
* Without this knowledge, the ability to properly govern your data and leverage its value is greatly hampered.
* Without deliberate actions, data democratization becomes elusive.
* Unfortunately, over time, the situation often deteriorates. Whether because of culture, strategy (or lack of strategy), systems design, budgets, mergers, or any number of other dynamics, data sets get siloed.
* A data silo is a data repository controlled by an entity in an organization but not frequently shared or known by other parts of the business.
* Data silos hinder business efficiencies because they reduce collaboration and increase data inconsistencies.
* Data governance helps eliminate unnecessary data siloes and makes data discoverable and available whenever and wherever it adds value.
* Unfortunately, most organizations don’t automatically come with a universal search engine that can help locate and serve up any type of data or information stored in the enterprise.
* Being able to tame and explore data sprawl — a term for the myriad of data types and sources that most businesses grapple with today — is not easily achieved without investing specialized effort.
* The ease at which you access data from across the Internet via a browser is seldom the experience in a business.
* In a weird twist, it’s often easier to find information about your organization by Googling it rather than using your own internal search systems.
* Of course, if the data is protected behind your organization’s firewall, a public search engine won’t help either.

# Knowing what data is available is essential for the following reasons:

* Better informed decision-making.
* Ensuring compliance and regulatory requirements.
* Lower costs by avoiding duplicate system and data efforts.
* Improved data analytics and reporting.
* Higher performing systems.
* More efficient operations.
* Reducing data inconsistencies across the enterprise.

# Data Catalogs

* Another, increasingly popular, method of data discoverability is the creation of an enterprise data catalog.
* Like a store catalog that categorizes products and includes details such as availability and price, a data catalog lists the availability of data sets and includes a wide range of valuable details about that data.

# The three essential benefits of data catalogs are:

* Finding data: Helps users identify and locate data that may be useful.
* Understanding data:  Answers a wide variety of data questions such as its purpose and who uses it.
* Making data more useful:  Creates visibility, describes value, and provides access to information.

* A data catalog delivers a comprehensive inventory that provides an enterprise view of all data.
* A data catalog is more than just a list of all data sets. Sure, for many organizations, this feature alone would add enormous value. What makes a data catalog particularly valuable is that it contains data about the data.
* It’s called metadata. This content can be curated manually and also by automated processes which can acquire it from other sources. Artificial intelligence (AI) is now playing a growing role in the latter.

# A data catalog can contain three types of metadata

* Technical metadata:  Data about the design of a data set such as its tables, columns, file names, and other documentation related to the source system.
* Business metadata:  Organizational data such as a business description, how it is used, its relevancy, an assessment of data quality, and users and their interactions.
* Operational metadata:  Data such as when the data was last accessed, who accessed it, and when was it last backed up.

# Examples of metadata include the following:

* Associated systems.
* File names.
* File locations.
* Data owners.
* Data descriptions.
* Dates created.
* Dates last modified.
* List of database tables and views.
* Data stewards.
* Size of data sets.
* Quality score.
* Comments.

* For a large number of stakeholders ranging from data analysts to data stewards, a data catalog presents many advantages. Primarily, the ability to find data tops the list. But it provides much more than that.

# With a data catalog, an organization can:

* Know what data it has (and by extension, know what data is missing).
* Reduce data duplication.
* Increase operational efficiencies and innovation.
* Understand data quality.
* Manage compliance.
* Enjoy cost savings from improved operations.

# Things to note
* A well-managed data catalog can be transformational for an organization.
* The effort to create and maintain one should not be understated.
* But, without a doubt, a data catalog is often the basis for delivering successful data governance and data management.

# Case Study: Unlocking Data Silos With a Data Catalog

# Background

* A European power company has embraced data governance in support of its mission of decarbonizing the production of electricity.
* The organization generates and distributes energy across multiple countries.
* Data is essential to every part of their business. For example, daily operations, like evaluating equipment performance, require deep data insights.
* Making data central to these tasks translates to considerable cost savings.
* Protecting data from misuse is also important. Not only must the business adhere to the regulatory requirements in all countries where they operate — but they must also comply with Europe’s General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR), which governs the use of personal data. Failure to do so can result in fines totaling millions of euros.

# Problem Statement

* The challenge facing the company was how to power its mission by enabling business units and partners to collaborate using the business and technical data locked away in siloed systems, while also ensuring a high degree of data compliance.

# The Solution

* They found a large part of the solution in the implementation of a data catalog with robust data governance functionality.
* The data catalog facilitated collaboration and innovation by enabling vastly improved search and discovery of data across the organization.
* In addition, team members could share their expertise through articles in the catalog, speeding the transfer of knowledge throughout the company.
* Compliance requirements were improved by the catalog interface guiding compliant behavior using workflows.
* In this way, the data catalog taught people how to use data compliantly and ensured they followed the relevant policies based on the data at hand.
